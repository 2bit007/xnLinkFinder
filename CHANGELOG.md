## Changelog

- v1.6

  - Changed

    - Replace any occurrences of HTML Entity `&quot;` before looking for links. There was a target that had links links like `<span class="xxx">&quot;https://target.com/api/v1&quot;>` which weren't being extracted.
    - Added `,.zip,.gz,.tar,.7z,.deb,.dmg` to `DEFAULT_LINK_EXCLUSIONS` constant and `LINK_EXCLUSIONS` in `config.yml`. There would be no valid links obtained from these types of raw files.
    - Correct the conversion between bytes and megabytes when checking the `-mfs` argument.
    - Exclude a link if it doesn't have printable characters

- v1.5

  - Changed
    - Base the length of the progress bar (show when downloading archived responses) on the width of the terminal so it displays better and you don't get multiple lines on smaller windows.
    - Use a better way to add trailing spaces to strings to cover up other strings (like SIGINT message), regardless of terminal width.

- v1.4

  - New
    - Sometimes a domain may return nothing (e.g. touch.com.lb) where a certificate verification error is raised. If this does happen, an error message will be displayed to suggest using the `-insecure` option.
  - Changed
    - For some reason, when User-Agent `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0.1` is used with `yahoo.com` it returns a 403 error. I have no idea why, of if it's an issue with other domains, but I've removed it just in case.
    - Base the length of the progress bar (shown when searching a Directory, Burp file or Zap files) on the width of the terminal so it displays better and you don't get multiple lines on smaller windows.

- v1.3

  - New
    - In addition to links, xnLinkFinder will now find potential parameters from the links and responses!
    - Additional keys in `config.yml` to narrow down what is searched for potential parameters (see README).
    - New argument `-op / --output-params` to specify the file that potential parameters are written to
  - Changed
    - Fixed a problem introduced in v1.2 that prevented any output for Burp and Zap files! Sorry!! :/
    - Amend `setup.py` to include `urlparse3` that is now used to get the path of links found
    - Amend `.gitignore` to include other unwanted files

- v1.2

  - New
    - If a directory is passed as input, process all files in that directory plus all sub directories.
  - Changed
    - If a directory is passed with `-i`, when `-mfs` is given a value of 0 (Zero) then no files will be ignored, regardless of size.
    - Add setup files and directories to `.gitignore`

- v1.1

  - New
    - Created this CHANGELOG.md file!
    - Add .gitignore file to exclude output.txt
    - Added functionality to allow output to be piped to another program. The output file will still be written. Errors and progress bar are written to STDERR
    - Added functionality to allow input to br piped to xnLinkFinder. A Burp or ZAP file cannot be piped and must use `-i` for these.
  - Changed
    - Fixed a bug that gets an incorrect number of responses in a ZAP file if the is binary image data in the file. The `grep` statement used has to use the `--text` argument.
    - Do a hard exit if someone keeps pressing Ctrl-C
    - Links were only being prefixed with `-sp` value if the found link started with `/`. Now, a link will be prefixed if it doesn't start with http, or the domain or prefix, in case we miss out on a valid link. For example, if `-sp http://exmaple.com` was used and link `index.html` was found, it wasn't prefixed before and just returned as `index.html`. Now it will be returned as `http://exmaple.com/index.html`.
    - Fixed a bug where Header, and therefore ContentType, wasn't correctly retrieved for responses in an OWASP ZAP file.
    - A few minor tweaks here and there!
